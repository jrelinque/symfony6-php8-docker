# A bastinazo Symfony 6 / PHP 8 docker from CÃ¡diz

Thanks to the current code from repository, we'll get a bunch of dockers with:
 
 * **PHP 8.1**
 * **Symfony 6**
 * **MySQL**
 * **PhpMyAdmin**
 
But, first of all, you'll need:
 
 * **Docker and docker-compose:** All the provided infrastructure to work locally is based on containers and docker-compose.
 * **Make:** In order to help and to unify, we use Make (via [Makefile](Makefile)) with the basic docker-compose commands (build, up) but indicating the needed parameters. Performing the command *make help* you will see all the possibilities:
     ```

    build                          Build environment
    destroy                        Stop and destroy the containers
    down                           Destroy the containers
    logs                           Show logs from all containers
    ps                             Show started containers
    restart                        Stop the containers and start them again
    shell-php                      Log into the PHP container
    shell-database                 Log into the MySQL Database container
    up                             Builds (if the container didn't exist previously) the image and start the containers.

Make it simple. The only things you have to execute is:
    
    jrelinque@ws-jrelinque: **make build**
    jrelinque@ws-jrelinque: **make up**

In order to log into the Php container and create a new Symfony project you should do this:

    jrelinque@ws-jrelinque: make shell-php
    php: symfony new .
    
Maybe you want to connect another git repository to your local installation through an App project. So you have to place into the docker folder and run:

    jrelinque@ws-jrelinque: cd app
    jrelinque@ws.jrelinque: git clone <your-app-git-repo> .
